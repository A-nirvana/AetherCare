# 🩺 AetherCare Dashboard

**AetherCare** is an AI-powered, real-time health monitoring dashboard designed to work with our custom-built wearable device. Developed during the **Hacksagon National Hackathon**, this system enables proactive healthcare using **IoT + ML**, built with affordability and scalability in mind.

💡 Built for **less than ₹3000**, AetherCare tracks and analyzes critical vitals, predicts over **54+ medical conditions**, and enables **instant emergency response** — all in seconds.

## 🔍 Overview

AetherCare Dashboard provides two key interfaces:

- **User Dashboard**: For individuals to monitor their real-time health data and risk status.
- **Responder Dashboard**: For emergency teams to get live alerts, GPS location, and critical vitals when a user enters a risky state.

All data is captured by the wearable and pushed to Firebase, where it's processed and visualized on the dashboard.
